# 📘 Facebook App

This application leverages the Facebook API to enhance user interaction with their profile data.
Developed in C# using WinForms as part of a Design Patterns course, it extends Facebook’s core functionality with two custom features. 
The project showcases integration with the Facebook API alongside the practical application of UML-based design patterns.
